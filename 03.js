// The right side of the assignment must be an expression so that the result is always a value. The result of expressions are always a value.

// Expression: Are values which answers are given by Javascript(Js Compiler)

// Expression: A question to JavaScript
// As question can be both simple and complex so are the Expressions

// What are literals(number, object or string literals)
// literals are expressions or questions which are themselves the answer
// For ex: let pet = 2 or let hat = "I am a hat"
// Here 2 is a expression which result itself is 2
// Also the expression "I am a hat" result itself as "I am a hat"

// So this type of simpler expressions(Questions) which literally mean themselves are called literals
// 2 is a number literal 
// "I am a hat" is a string literal

// Let's say :
// we console pet

let pet = 2;
console.log(pet);

// Did we really pass pet variable to console.log
// No, we can't really pass varibles to a function
// When we pass variables we ask Js a Question
// What is the values of the varible ???? let's say pet???
// So variables can serve as an expressions too !!!

// The left side must be a wire
// "Wire" which is named as varible which works as a "wire"
// And the right side must be an expression which results in a value


// # Note: Our UNIVERSE is full or wires

// Primitive data types are immutable: They are permanent part of our Js universe
// They can't be created, destroy, change
// For ex: String are primitive so we cannot set(changing) a property to a string value
// But Arrays are not primitive so we can set properties to a Array values

// Variables are not values 
// They point to values
// We can change at what values they are pointing at using the assignment ("=") operator.

// Varibles are like wire: "Wires" are not a Js concepts. But they let us imagine how varibles points to values. We we do assigment there is a wire on the left always a wire on the left side during assignment and an expression(resulting in a value) on the right side.

// If you see contradiction donot get discouraged. When there is one understand that there is a deeper truth hidden underneath. Find it !!!

// We are just building mental modals of Js which the React Community shares
// This may be slight nitpicking but it important for us to have a precise understanding behind the terms we are using to have an more accurate mental modal about the fundamental of our universe

// QUIZ

// varibles donot have type values do
// So the type of a varible depends upon which value the varible is currently pointing to!!!
