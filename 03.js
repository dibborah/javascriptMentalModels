// The right side of the assignment must be an expression so that the result is always a value. The result of expressions are always a value.

// Expression: Are values which answers are given by Javascript(Js Compiler)

// Expression: A question to JavaScript
// As question can be both simple and complex so are the Expressions

// What are literals(number, object or string literals)
// literals are expressions or questions which are themselves the answer
// For ex: let pet = 2 or let hat = "I am a hat"
// Here 2 is a expression which result itself is 2
// Also the expression "I am a hat" result itself as "I am a hat"

// So this type of simpler expressions(Questions) which literally mean themselves are called literals
// 2 is a number literal 
// "I am a hat" is a string literal
